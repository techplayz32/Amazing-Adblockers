## uBlock Origin vs uBlock Origin Lite
This first segement will talk about uBO Lite, if you are using the uBO, please scroll down for the uBO segement.
### uBlock Origin Lite
#### Quick Start
Starting off, uBlock Origin Lite is just special version for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, which is not that powerful due Manifest V3.
Many of sites may not block ads at ALL with Lite version. So if you are still on Edge or Chrome, suggesting switch to **Firefox** or **Brave**.

Of course, you can change filtering mode, but with more intesive filtering - more memory & CPU usage, how said in the description of final.
In uBO, it wouldn't happen like in Lite version. (about memory & cpu usage)
