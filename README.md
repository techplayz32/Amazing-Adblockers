Look and compare the each of adblocker in current year!

## Why we need this?
Currently, there are many of ad blockers in our time and we can't decide, which ad blocker efficient, which not.
If you don't want to decide which is the best, just take and use **[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)**[^1] with **[recommended filterlists](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists)**.
[^1]: For **Google Chrome** users which not using `ExtensionManifestV2Availability`[^2] policy, use **[uBlock Origin Lite](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home)**
[^2]: `ExtensionManifestV2Availability` policy is for **Google Chrome Enterprise** *(can be also enabled for regular google chrome)* which extends period of Manifest V2 usage.
